# 🌀 3D Sine Games

An experimental visual experience using sine waves and 3D graphics to create abstract, interactive animations. Built with p5.js, this project explores trigonometry, rotation, and creative coding techniques.

## 🚀 Live Demo  
🌐 [Try it here](https://roxanne007.github.io/3D-Sine-Games/)

## 🎮 What It Does

- Animates shapes and waves using `sin()` and `cos()` functions
- Rotates 3D objects in space with smooth transitions
- Creates hypnotic patterns and geometric illusions
- Explores colour, motion, and mathematical beauty in real time

## 🔧 Features

- 3D rendering via `WEBGL` mode
- Dynamic sine wave manipulation
- Interactive camera rotation or timed oscillations
- Fluid animations based on frameCount
- Colour blending and waveform distortions

## 🛠 Built With

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) – Creative coding framework
- JavaScript
- Trigonometry + sine functions

## 🎨 Creative Possibilities

This project was created to explore generative art and motion design using mathematical principles. It could evolve into:

- A visualiser for sound or music
- A generative background tool
- A coding art installation
- A base for interactive games or simulations
